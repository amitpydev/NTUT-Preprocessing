# NTUT 4K Drone Photo Dataset Preprocessing

This repository hosts Python scripts for converting the "NTUT 4K Drone Photo Dataset for Human Detection" into YOLOv5-compatible format. The aim is to prepare high-resolution drone imagery from the dataset for use in YOLOv5 models, facilitating machine learning tasks related to human detection.

## Dataset

Download the dataset directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kuantinglai/ntut-4k-drone-photo-dataset-for-human-detection/data). Additional information about the dataset can be accessed on its [official website](https://datasetninja.com/ntut-4k-drone-photo).

## Installation

Ensure Python is installed on your system. Clone this repository to get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amitpydev/NTUT-Preprocessing.git
cd NTUT-Preprocessing
```

No external `requirements.txt` is necessary as the script handles dependency checks and installations.

## Usage

Ensure that the downloaded `archive.zip` file from Kaggle is either in the same directory as the script or specify its path using the `--zip_path` argument.

### Running the Script

To process the dataset and prepare it for YOLOv5, execute the following command, specifying the path to the ZIP file and the output processed data folder:

```bash
python main.py --zip_path="archive.zip" --yolov5_data_path="path_to_yolov5_output_directory"
```

This will convert the dataset annotations to YOLOv5 format and save them to the specified directory.

### Optional Arguments

- `--use_recognizable`: This flag can be included to categorize all tracking labels (e.g., ID_***) as 'Recognizable' within the YOLOv5 annotations.
